<h1>review of: SubaHibi/Wonderful Everyday</h1>
<h1>wip im not done yet lol</h1>
<h2> spoiler warning for the entire vn and the endings</h2>
<p>this is actually my first traditional visual novel and was debating on reading either subahibi or higurashi but ended up reading this one first because it just mainly piqued my interest.</p>
<p>other than that, i first started around the start of 2023 if im correct (i cant actually remember the exact date lol). installation with patches was fine other than at some point i realized i needed the extra voices patch, you should be fine when downloading the patches for this game, especially because an unpatched version of subahibi only allows the reader to go through chapter 1, leaving out the rest of the chapters actually.</p>

<h3>chapter 1: down the rabbit-hole I</h3>
<p>honestly when i was reading this chapter it just felt really slow to me in my opinion but overall it seemed like a nice slice of life chapter, i knew beforehand that shit would go down at some point but i actually didnt know if it was going to be in this chapter or in the next. anyway while reading i felt like most of the stuff zakuro talked about went over my head, especially when she was talking with yuki (protagonist for this chapter) on the rooftop, i couldn't really understand that much.</p>
<p>at some point i dropped the vn at around this time (maybe around like late janurary or feburary i still cant remember LOL) and mostly ended up forgetting about it, but around june of 2023 was when i started picking it back up again. im not sure why i decided to read it again but i guess at that time i had nothing better to do. </p>
<p>continuing on, when finishing up the chapter the train section part was the most confusing to me, it literally went all over my head but i knew that a lot of this was very important later on. in the end i thought this chapter was good, i just had difficulty understanding this stuff but oh man i didnt know how different the game was going to become next chapter</p>

<h3>chapter 2: down the rabbit-hole II</h3>
<p>this is where the game starts to get good for most people. i would say its very similar to chapter 1 (not really) but the game completely shifts from a normal slice of life to a mystery with the death of zakuro and two other girls.</p>
